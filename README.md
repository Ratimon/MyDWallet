# MyDWallet(Under Development)


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

# The Purpose
1. To create very simple prototype of decenterised web application and intregrate
the latest blockchain based framework - truffle version 3 and the frondend one -Angular 2
2. Write and the solidity contracts and their test cases


# Technology
1. HTML
2. CSS
   * Bootstrap
    * Jquery.js
3. Typescript
   * Angular2
4. Smart Database with Block Chain
   * Truffle
   * Solidity
5. Webpack2

#  API
1. Web3 JavaScript √êapp API


#  Requirement
1. Via contract, users can receive ether from any body
2. Show the current balance
3. List all immutable transactions
4. Responsive


#  Installation
1. install testrpc which is a Node.js based Ethereum client for testing and development. It uses ethereumjs to simulate full client behavior and make developing Ethereum applications much faster. It also includes all popular RPC functions and features (like events) and can be run deterministically      to make development a breeze. and run
    ```
    $ npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc
    ```
2. install truffle
    ```
    $ npm install -g truffle
    ```

3. start using the app with
    ```
    $ npm install 
    $ npm run startd
    $ testrpc
    ```

4. You can also test th contract
    ```
    truffle test
    ```

# Underdevelopment I will fix it (If possible)
1. User can only run to bundle all of typescript code on developement mode not production mode (You can bundle but it does't work)
2. Via contract, users can add or remove the specific people to withdraw and deposit their ether


# Live Website
Thereis no live website, since it is a decenterised application.
